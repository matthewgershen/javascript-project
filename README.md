# JavaScript Project Proposal

Skyscraper is a game inspired by the gameplay of [Stack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxsYDzts1Dg) and [Tower Block](http://www.abcya.com/tower_blocks.htmm). It will be a 2d stacking game, with a block swinging from the top, dropping down at the right time to build the tower. Any "overflow" will crumble away, making that block smaller and thus, the difficulty will increase.
