# JavaScript Project Proposal

Skyscraper is a game inspired by the gameplay of [Stack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxsYDzts1Dg) and [Tower Block](http://www.abcya.com/tower_blocks.htmm). It will be a 2d stacking game, with a block swinging from the top, dropping down at the right time to build the tower. Any "overflow" will crumble away, making that block smaller and thus, the difficulty will increase.

### Functionality & MVP

* Start game
* Block swings and drops
* Block overflow crumbles
* High score tracking

##### Bonus
* Color gradient
* Music/sounds

### Architecture and Technologies

JavaScript for game logic
Canvas for game art
[not sure yet] for music/sounds

### Timeline

Day 1: Set up framework

Day 2: Create block objects, swinging, falling

Day 3: Crumble away logic/high scores

Day 4: Polish/Bonus
